# Data-Engineering-Project

  Welcome to the Data-Engineering-Project repository! This project is designed to showcase key concepts and skills in data engineering, including data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL), and pipeline creation.

#Project Overview

  This project aims to:

   * Extract raw data from various sources.
   * Transform the data to make it usable for analysis.
   * Load the processed data into a target destination (e.g., a database, data warehouse).
   *  Automate and monitor data pipelines.

  #Steps Involved:
   * Environment Setup
   * Data Ingestion
   * Data Transformation
   * Data Loading
   * Data Reporting
   * End to End Pipeline Testing
